#### 如何实现无锁队列

通过原子操作实现无锁队列



```
#include <atomic>
template<typename T>
struct node
{
    T data;
    node* next;
    node(const T& data) : data(data), next(nullptr) {}
};
 
template<typename T>
class stack
{
    std::atomic<node<T>*> head;
 public:
    void push(const T& data)
    {
      node<T>* new_node = new node<T>(data);
 
      // put the current value of head into new_node->next
      new_node->next = head.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
 
      // now make new_node the new head, but if the head
      // is no longer what's stored in new_node->next
      // (some other thread must have inserted a node just now)
      // then put that new head into new_node->next and try again
      while(!head.compare_exchange_weak(new_node->next, new_node,
                                        std::memory_order_release,
                                        std::memory_order_relaxed))
          ; // the body of the loop is empty
 
// Note: the above use is not thread-safe in at least 
// GCC prior to 4.8.3 (bug 60272), clang prior to 2014-05-05 (bug 18899)
// MSVC prior to 2014-03-17 (bug 819819). The following is a workaround:
//      node<T>* old_head = head.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
//      do {
//          new_node->next = old_head;
//       } while(!head.compare_exchange_weak(old_head, new_node,
//                                           std::memory_order_release,
//                                           std::memory_order_relaxed));
    }
};
int main()
{
    stack<int> s;
    s.push(1);
    s.push(2);
    s.push(3);
}
```



#### compare_exchange_weak

Atomically compares the [object representation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object) (until C++20)[value representation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object) (since C++20) of `*this` with that of `expected`, and if those are bitwise-equal, replaces the former with `desired` (performs read-modify-write operation). Otherwise, loads the actual value stored in `*this` into `expected` (performs load operation).

The memory models for the read-modify-write and load operations are `success` and `failure` respectively. In the (2) and (4) versions `order` is used for both read-modify-write and load operations, except that [std::memory_order_acquire](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order) and [std::memory_order_relaxed](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order) are used for the load operation if order == [std::memory_order_acq_rel](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order), or order == [std::memory_order_release](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order) respectively.

```
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
 
std::atomic<int>  ai;
 
int  tst_val= 4;
int  new_val= 5;
bool exchanged= false;
 
void valsout()
{
    std::cout << "ai= " << ai
	      << "  tst_val= " << tst_val
	      << "  new_val= " << new_val
	      << "  exchanged= " << std::boolalpha << exchanged
	      << "\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    ai= 3;
    valsout();
 
    // tst_val != ai   ==>  tst_val is modified
    exchanged= ai.compare_exchange_strong( tst_val, new_val );
    valsout();
 
    // tst_val == ai   ==>  ai is modified
    exchanged= ai.compare_exchange_strong( tst_val, new_val );
    valsout();
}
```
